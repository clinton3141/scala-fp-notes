# Notes and exercises as I work through [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)

I imagine that it'll be an incoherant mess to read as an outsider, but it's useful for me to have it all in one place.

Yeah yeah, I know that there's an [official repo for the book](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala). I did fork it,
but then decided that I'd like to get my fingers used to typing Scala again. So I've taken the decision to start from
scratch and type out the boilerplate myself, and release my inner n00b.
